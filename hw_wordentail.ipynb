    "It is very easy to subclass `TorchShallowNeuralClassifier` if all you want to do is change the network graph: all you have to do is write a new `define_graph`. If your graph has new arguments that the user might want to set, then you should also redefine `__init__` so that these values are accepted and set as attributes.\n",

The result is fed to the user's activation function $f$, and the result of that is fed through another linear layer to produce $h_{3}$. (Inside `TorchShallowNeuralClassifier`, $h_{3}$ is the basis for a softmax classifier, so no activation function is applied to it.)\n",
