The crucial parameter that enables this is `vectorize=False`. This essentially says to `rel_ext.experiment` that your featurizer or your model will do the work of turning examples into vectors; in that case, `rel_ext.experiment` just organizes these representations by relation type."

    "There are many options, and this could easily grow into a project. Here are a few ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try out different classifier models, from `sklearn` and elsewhere.\n",
    "- Add a feature that indicates the length of the middle.\n",
    "- Augment the bag-of-words representation to include bigrams or trigrams (not just unigrams).\n",
    "- Introduce features based on the entity mentions themselves. <!-- \\[SPOILER: it helps a lot, maybe 4% in F-score. And combines nicely with the directional features.\\] -->\n",
    "- Experiment with features based on the context outside (rather than between) the two entity mentions — that is, the words before the first mention, or after the second.\n",
    "- Try adding features which capture syntactic information, such as the dependency-path features used by Mintz et al. 2009. The [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) toolkit contains a variety of [parsing algorithms](http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.parse.html) that may help.\n",
    "- The bag-of-words representation does not permit generalization across word categories such as names of people, places, or companies. Can we do better using word embeddings such as [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, please provide a brief technical description of your original system, so that the teaching team can gain an understanding of what it does. This will help us to understand your code and analyze all the submissions to identify patterns and strategies."

    " the longest sequence of text (taken from examples based on the `how` parameter). We use the GloVe dictionary where we\n",
    " lookup each word in lowercase format (due to standard preprocessing of GloVe). \n",
    " To summarize the parameters used in the grid search are:\n",

    "  - bidirectional : True if we want the LSTM to go both forward and backward on the input sequence\n",
    "  - max_words : max words per sequence generation\n",
